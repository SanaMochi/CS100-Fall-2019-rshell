<h1> Introduction </h1>
We have created a shell in C++ called rshell, which is able to do the following: 

1. Print a command prompt (e.g. `$`)
2. Read in a line of command(s) (and connector(s)) from standard input
3. Execute the appropriate commands using `fork` , `execvp` , and `waitpid` 

<h1> Diagram </h1>

*TO-DO*

1. Make an OMT diagram using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
2. Add the image to the `/images` folder and link it here

<h1> Classes </h1>

*TO-DO*

1. When we figure out what classes we need, add them here and describe them

<h1> Prototypes / Reaserch </h1>

Insert relavant prototypes that we have made that using `fork()` , `execvp()` , and `waitpid()`, and figure out a parser to use to get input from the console (maybe `std::cin' ?)



<h1> Development and Testing Roadmap </h1>

* Figure out a parser to use
* Create relavant classes that work with the parser (for inputs such as `&&` , `||` , `;`)
* Make integration tests using the `googletest` framework
* Create [Github issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) for each partner to work on
* Add more items as they become necessary
